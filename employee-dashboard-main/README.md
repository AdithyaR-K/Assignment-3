# Employee Dashboard (React)

Simple React app (Vite) implementing an Employee Dashboard and an Employee Form.

Features:
- Navbar with Home and Employee Form links
- Home / Dashboard fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and displays id, name and email
- Employee Form with Name, Designation, Location and Salary
- Uses Bootstrap for styling via CDN

Run locally:

```bash
# from workspace root (where package.json was created)
npm install
npm run dev

# Open the URL printed by vite (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal demo. Submitting the Employee Form shows the submitted data in the page and console.
